# Secret Santa

## Features

The app allows a general user to:

- draw a random name from a set of names of people partaking in the secret santa event
- create and update a personal wishlist of items to help whoever draws their name
- create and update a list of hobbies and interests that they're interested in getting a gift for to help whoever draws their name
- anonymously ask questions to and receive feedback from the person whose name they draw

The app allows an organizer user to:

- set (and update) the names (and emails) of the gift exchange participants
- create exclusions for who shouldn't draw whom (if there are enough group members)
- add a group name for the gift exchange
- set the date of the gift exchange
- send out invitation emails to the participants

> Unfortunately, that isn't possible; the draw can only be done once. You can't change the exclusions after the names have been drawn either. It is however possible to remove someone from the group after the names have been drawn. If you want to redraw the names, the organizer can set up a new group with a different name.
