# Secret Santa

## Features

The app allows a general user to:

- draw a random name from a set of names of people partaking in the secret santa event
- create a personal wishlist of items to help whoever draws their name
- create a list of hobbies and interests that they're interested in getting a gift for to help whoever draws their name
- anonymously ask questions to and receive feedback from the person whose name they draw

The app allows an organizer user to:

- set (and update) the names (and emails) of the gift exchange participants
- create exclusions for who shouldn't draw whom (if there are enough group members)
- add a group name for the gift exchange
- set the date of the gift exchange
